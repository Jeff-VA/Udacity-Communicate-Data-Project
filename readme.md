### Project Title
Analysis and visualization of Prosper Loan Data

### Description
This exploration of 113,937 loan observations demonstrates the power of python code for use in communicating data through explanatory visualization.  Though the original dataset here has upwards of 80 loan variables to analyze, 10 were chosen and compared to  the borrower APR for simplicity.  Since the specific goal here is to find insight though visualization, a process of univariate, bivariate and multivariate visualization forged a path to a few insights of value. 

Below is a link to a slideshow presentation of the eplanitory visualizations found in the Prosper loan data:
